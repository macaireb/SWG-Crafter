0) Move Layout functions out of craft.py, and into layout.py for object
	oriented sake

1) Save Multiple Layouts
	create a textbook to input file name
		append distinct filename, to use when loading
		in future version run necesarry checks and error handling

2) Load Multiple Layouts
	search current directory for layout extension
	draw/place a dropdown list populated with previously saved layouts
	draw and place a load button to confirm selected layout before load
